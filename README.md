# SOAR EDR Integration Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) with EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) systems using a virtualized environment. The objective was to automate security workflows, enhance threat intelligence capabilities with LimaCharlie, and enable real-time alerting via Slack.

## Objective
The SOAR EDR Integration Project aimed to create an automated security operations environment using SOAR solutions. The goal was to integrate SOAR capabilities with EDR systems, automate incident response workflows with Tines, and send alerts via Slack for real-time notifications.

## Skills Acquired
- Mastery of SOAR and EDR system integration techniques.
- Advanced configuration of LimaCharlie for effective threat intelligence.
- Proficiency in automating security workflows with Tines.
- Expertise in setting up real-time alerting through Slack and email.
- Hands-on experience with virtualized environments for cybersecurity testing.
- Development of custom detection and response rules and comprehensive playbooks.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initial difficulties with integrating LimaCharlie with the SOAR platform.
  - **Solution:** Modified the API configuration and tested with dummy data before going live.

- **Challenge:** Automating incident response workflows with Tines.
  - **Solution:** Created a custom playbook to handle specific incident types, which allowed for more effective and streamlined responses.

## Conclusion
The successful integration of SOAR with EDR was achieved, resulting in a more efficient and automated incident response workflow. The project demonstrates the power of automation in modern cybersecurity operations. Future improvements could involve integrating more complex response actions and expanding the intelligence sources used in LimaCharlie.

## Future Work
- Integrating additional EDR solutions to enhance detection capabilities.
- Expanding the automation workflow to include more complex incident response scenarios.
- Implementing a dashboard for real-time monitoring and analytics of security events.
